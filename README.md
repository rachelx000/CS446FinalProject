# Comparative Analysis of Genetic Interaction Networks in *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster* from an Evolutionary Perspective

This project aims to analyze and compare the genetic interaction networks in *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster*. Initially, it identifies genes with the highest degree centrality and betweenness centrality in two GI networks. Then, it examines the top three evolutionarily preferred three-vertex motifs with the highest frequencies present in both networks and those never present in each network. Through an evolutionary lens, the comparison of these network properties reveals similar patterns of genetic interactions, suggesting the presence of evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms in the two model organisms. This may provide insights into common molecular mechanisms shared among animals, contributing to our understanding of biological processes across species.
